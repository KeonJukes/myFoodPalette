## 🚀 The Problem & The Solution

### ⚠️ The Problem
[Briefly explain the pain point, challenge, or need you decided to address. **Why does this matter?**]

*Example: Many diet-sharing apps are complicated or overly focused on calorie counting, making it difficult for users to simply share the *diversity* and *quality* of their meals in a fun, social way.*

### ✅ The Solution
[Describe how your application solves the problem. **What is the core value proposition?**]

*Example: myFoodPalette provides a simple, visual, and engaging platform for users to post photos of their meals, tag the main food groups, and receive encouraging feedback, turning diet tracking into a shared, colorful experience.*
